Python Scripts:

dataset_visualization.py: 
1-Uploading and preparing images for use:
Pictures are transformed into grayscale, adjusted to 48x48 pixels, and changed into numpy arrays (X).
Labels (y) are created using the folder arrangement (class_names) and counting the images per class.

2-Distribution of the class:
A bar graph displays how images are divided among various categories (Angry, Happy, Neutral, Engaged).

3-Distribution of pixel intensity for each class:
Graphs are created for each category displaying the range of pixel values in the black-and-white images.

4-Examples of Images and Distribution of Pixel Intensity for Individual Class:
15 random sample images are chosen for each class and their pixel intensity histograms are shown next to them.
